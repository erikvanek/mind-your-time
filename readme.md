# Mind your time
Browser extension to help you keep track of where you spend your time in your browser

## Things to fix
- needs investigation - when link from facebook with its internal redirect is pasted and the redirect button is clicked, redirected content does not seem to be tracked
- focusing might not stop the timer
- maybe consider updating the count in a loop to 'catch' long scrolls instead of waiting for a redirect / tab switch
